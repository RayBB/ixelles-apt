# Ixelles Appointments

A blog post about this project is here: https://raybb.hashnode.dev/automating-ixelles-appointment-checking

# Purpose
To help me get appointments sooner for the Ixelles municipality in Brussels, Belgium.

When applying for a residence permit I had to do these two types of appointments.

Unfortunately, they weren't available for months but the office told me to check the site frequently for updates.

Sadly, the site requires several clicks, and is quite slow, to check for new times.

So, I made this small tool to just grab the times of the two appointment types I'm interested in.

The code is very sloppy as this was just a quick hack to save me some hassle.
